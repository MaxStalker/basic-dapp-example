# Summary
This repository contains the code to create a basic Flow DApp.

Initially I was thinking to remove React in order to make the code more accessible, expecially to people who don't use it in day-to-day basis. 
But as a side effect UI interaction part become unnecessary "complex" and maybe harder to read. I will try to clean it out and push changes.

I would recommend to use it as a reference on how to interact with Flow Blockchain, but not as a best practice example.

# Requirements
In order for this example to work you will need to install:
 - [Flow ClI](https://docs.onflow.org/docs/cli)
 - [Dev-Wallet](https://github.com/onflow/flow-js-sdk/tree/master/packages/dev-wallet)
 
 Also, please notice, that script is using `set` prefix to set environment variable on Windows, please update the code accordingly if you are on Linux/MacOS machine.
